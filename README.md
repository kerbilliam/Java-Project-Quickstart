# About This Repository

This repository contains my guides to quickly set up a Java project with Git and collaborate with others using GitHub.

I have made 2 videos that go over how to do so within IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code respectively. They do not cover absolutely everything you need to know, but they contain enough to get you and your team quickly started on your project. It is completly possible to complete a project using only what is covered in the videos, but I hope you can use what you've learned as a stepping point to learn more on how Git and GitHub works.

For those who would like to learn more about Git and don't mind using the command-line, I have made 2 written guides, and 1 video guide on how to create and set up a Java project with Git and GitHub. These guides cover more concepts and examples that allow for a more deeper understanding on what you are doing. Plus, in my personal opinion, I believe using the command-line is faster and cooler.

Alternatively, you can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/4UBpOfvAaQw) which covers most of what is in `README.dev.md`. It is inteded as a supplemental video, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
